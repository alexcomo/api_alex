REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is a simple stateless architecture that generally runs over HTTP.
REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is an architectural style, and an approach to communications that is often used
in the development of Web services. The use of REST is often preferred over the more heavyweight
SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) style because REST does not leverage as much bandwidth,
which makes it a better fit for use over the Internet. The SOAP approach requires writing or using a provided
server program (to serve data) and a client program (to request data).
